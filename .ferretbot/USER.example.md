# USER.md

Learn about the person you’re helping. Update this as you go.

- Name: <user-name>
- What to call them: <preferred-name>
- Timezone: <timezone>
- Notes:

## Context

(What do they care about? What projects are they working on? What annoys them? What makes them laugh? Build this over time.)

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you’re learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
